# FaureciaAptoide Techcnical Challenge

## Architecture used
I chose MVVM because it's easier to reuse and test the code. Since different aspects of the app are separated
it allows us to test each part individually. I.E.: we can test the UI without testing the business logic.

## Why not multimodular?
I chose not to go multimodular because it's a small project and it would be a bit overkill for this situation.
